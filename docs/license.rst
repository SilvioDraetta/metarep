License
=======

Your package should come with a license making clear what the users can
(and cannot) do with it.

The particular version that you want to use depends on the context and on your
own taste. As you are probably not a lawyer specialized in copyright law, there is
usually no need to reinvent the wheel---you'll be perfectly fine with one of the
alternatives on the market.

We shall take a religious stance for a second, here, and suggest that
you should use a fully-fledges `Copyleft`-type license, typically
`GPL 3.0 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`_ or later. Other very
popular (and permissive) choices include the
`MIT <https://opensource.org/license/mit>`_ license, the
`Apache-2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ or the
`BSD 3-Clause <https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause>`_ one. You will see these
a lot if you start browsing repositories.

From a practical standpoint you should include a brief comments at the beginning
of each source file, and ship a ``LICENSE`` file with your package---GPL 3.0 reads
